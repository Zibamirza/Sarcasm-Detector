# Sarcasm-Detector
Using the News Headlines Dataset from Huffington Post and The Onion, provided by BibTex (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection)
I have applied various transformer and conventional models to predict if an article is is_sarcastic: 1 if the record is sarcastic otherwise 0
The BERT model with stopword removal has shown to have the best performance with 92% accuracy
